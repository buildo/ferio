# ferio

A CLI tool to schedule your vacation at buildo

## Motivation

We have a very flexibly vacation policy at buildo, but we require to make your
vacations visible to the rest of the team in a few ways:

- Google Calendar (useful when scheduling meetings, etc)
- Teamweek (useful during planning)
- Slack (for legal tracking purposes)

Writing the same info in three different places is tedious and error prone.

`ferio` helps you in getting it right, with a clear declarative UX.

Moreover, `ferio` helps with other accessory tasks such as declining events you
won't attend during your vacation and deleting events you've created (if
necessary)
